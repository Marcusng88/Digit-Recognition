# Digit Recognition

This project aims to recognize digits from images using machine learning techniques and computer vision. It and allows for digit recognition via a graphical user interface (GUI).

## Features
- Recognizes digits from canvas sketching
- Uses pre-trained models.
- Built with neural networks
- Includes a GUI for easy interaction.

## Setup Instructions

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Marcusng-88/Digit-Recognition.git

2. Download the packages needed
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt

3. Run Main.py ,GUI.py

*This is just a learning project, accuracy can be improved
